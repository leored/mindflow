As User I want to open a existing [[Flow]]

You can find a [[Flow]] using the [[Flow Explorer Component]] and navigating for the folder tree structure.
One the User locates the Flow by name he can:
* doble-clic on the Flow
* Open contextual menu and hit the 'Open' Action


# Behaviour
* Once the User hit on the Flow name, the [[Flow Editor Component]] is opened. 
	* MindFlow check User's permissions to read, or write the Flow.
